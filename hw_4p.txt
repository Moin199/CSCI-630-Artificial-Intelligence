The decision tree for the input file given upto depth 1 finds the best split on column 4(if we are considering numbering the column from 1).
For depth 2, we find that the best split for the data is that if it column 4 is true, we select column 6 for splitting the data again.
Else, we find column 5 if the column 4 is False.

If we get Column 4 false and column 5 as true the tree predicts B
If we get Column 4 false and column 5 as false the tree predicts B
If we get Column 4 true and column 6 as true the tree predicts B
If we get Column 4 true and column 6 as false the tree predicts A


Output from Console:

for depth 1 best column for split:4
for depth 2 best columns for split:5 and 6
For column 4 true and column 6 true gives: B with count: 9
For column 4 true and column 6 false gives: A with count: 40
For column 4 false and column 5 false gives: B with count: 26
For column 4 false and column 5 true gives: B with count: 90
